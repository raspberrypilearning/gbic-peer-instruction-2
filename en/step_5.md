## Misconceptions

The misconceptions associated with each of the incorrect answers are as follows:

+ **b**	

Misconception = the program prints ‘b’

+ **a+1**	

Misconception = the program prints what we have been told ‘b’ stands for

+ **11**	

Misconception = ‘a’ and ‘b’ have not been added but combined


## Write your own question

--- task ---
Now that you have seen an MCQ that can be used in Peer Instruction, can you write your own?

Use a Year 8 unit of work that you are familiar with and identify a key concept that pupils need to understand in that unit. It might help to think about questions or common mistakes that you have encountered when teaching this unit. Remember the following principles for writing good MCQS:

+ Each incorrect answer should identify a single misconception
+ Questions must be achievable and possible to answer quickly. Don’t make them too hard
+ Make sure the tense and grammar of every answer matches the question (for example, don't have a question that refers to a plural and then answers that are singular)
+ Ensure each answer is independent and cannot be eliminated based on anything other than subject knowledge (i.e. don't include 'filler' answers)

## Extension activity

For pupils who show good understanding early in the process, you can ask them to complete the task you have just done as a challenge or extension. You will find a template provided for this activity in the resources.
+ Can they write an MCQ in which one of the other options would be correct?
+ Can they identify the misconceptions addressed by the incorrect answers?
