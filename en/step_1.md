## Introduction

You will be using the Peer Instruction approach to teach representations and Python programming. Learners need not be familiar with the topics at the start of the trial. Educators should be familiar with the topics. Each lesson plan offers detailed reference to subject knowledge.  Unit 1 Lesson Plans include sections: ‘Notes on pedagogy’ and ‘Background knowledge’. Unit 2 includes a section on ‘Useful excerpts’. Both Units’ Lesson Plans include an ‘Additional source’ section with links to further reading opportunities and online courses.

This session focuses on building up your expertise in advance of the project, as well as familiarising yourself with the resources. Over the rest of this online course, you will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out, and think about how to implement the sessions in your own classroom.


## Accessing the resources

First, you are going to access the session resources that you will need for the Peer Instruction project.

--- task ---
Open the Peer Instruction resource portal{:target="_blank"}, where you can explore all the resources for Lessons 1 to 12. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the Peer Instruction project. The main resources folder consists of four subfolders: Introduction to Peer Instruction, Unit 1_Representations: from clay to silicon, Unit 2_Python Programming, and Units Overview.

The resources prepared for the trial period include twelve 1-hour lessons. The first lesson provided is an introduction to Peer Instruction. In the subsequent weeks, you will be using adapted versions of lessons produced for the National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE) Teach Computing Curriculum [link]. The lessons include 6 weeks of a unit on representations, which gradually introduces learners to binary digits and how they can be used to represent text and numbers. The concepts are linked to practical applications and problems that the learners are familiar with. The unit begins with an introduction to how people have used representations over the course of history and a chance to think about the use of symbols before moving on to a focus on binary digits and number representation in binary. The last lesson in the unit familisarises learners with different units and terms for measuring representation size, such as 'megabyte'.

The second topic consists of 5 weeks of a unit introducing text-based programming in Python. The lessons form a journey that starts with elementary programs involving input and output and gradually moves on through arithmetic operations, randomness, selection and iteration. Emphasis is placed on tackling common misconceptions and exploring the mechanics of program execution. The unit begins by considering the differences between algorithms and programs, moving on to producing simple programs in Python and developing understanding of different ways to control program execution, such as if-else, if-elif-else, and while statements.
