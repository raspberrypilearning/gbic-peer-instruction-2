## Introduction

You will be using the 'Peer Instruction' approach to teach representations and Python programming. Pupils do not need an understanding of these concepts at the start of the project, but educators should be familiar with the topics. Each lesson plan offers detailed reference to subject knowledge; the lesson plans in Unit 1 include sections on ‘Background knowledge’ and ‘Useful excerpts’, while in Unit 2 they have a section about ‘Notes on pedagogy’. Lesson plans from both units include an ‘Additional sources’ section with links to further reading opportunities and online courses.

This session focuses on building up your expertise in advance of the project, as well as familiarising yourself with the resources. Over the rest of this online course, you will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out, and think about how to implement the sessions in your own classroom.


## Accessing the resources

First, you are going to access the session resources that you will need for the 'Peer Instruction' project.

--- task ---
Open the ['Peer Instruction' resource portal](http://ncce.io/pi8), where you can explore all the resources for Lessons 1 to 12. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the 'Peer Instruction' project.

The main resources folder consist of four subfolders: [Introduction to Peer Instruction](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EyTv-8_oLvMXKUZ2aa5BNTTX9s1uRENu), [Unit 1 – Representations: from clay to silicon](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyqSAn1a81-3HLFTbNwy6rcGMxiZJi-S), [Unit 2 – Python programming](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4p10V7mD8agupDCoPWTqqh2OJivUhaW), and [Units overview](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NGr0HW89GqEhDV1bCzsGnM_yOQSsgBps). 

The resources prepared for the project include twelve one-hour lessons. The first lesson is an introduction to Peer Instruction. In the subsequent weeks, you will use **adapted versions** of lessons produced for the National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE) Teach Computing Curriculum. The lessons include six weeks of a unit on representations, which gradually introduces pupils to binary digits and how they can be used to represent text and numbers. The concepts are linked to practical applications and problems that will be familiar to your pupils. 

The second topic consist of five weeks of a unit introducing text-based programming in Python. The unit begins by considering the differences between algorithms and programs, moving on to producing simple programs in Python and developing understanding of different ways to control program execution, such as **while**, **if, else**, and **if, elif, else** statements.
