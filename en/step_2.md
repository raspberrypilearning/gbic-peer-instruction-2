## Lesson plans and resources

You will find the lesson plans, slides and associated resources in separate folders for the introductory lesson, the Representations unit and the Python unit, along with an MCQ bank for each unit. 

Feel free to download the resources or access them each time you need them from the webpage. You may wish to bookmark the link to the resources in the browser toolbar of your tablet/iPad/computer for ease of reference in the classroom. You can also find links to all of the resources in your [Project Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sTwXM-oZx3GL-rG6Ctglfqg-ONAW9SaB6p--2Vj99s/edit) and [Units Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBrTQxOuugKFDbidHy9Ugt818tM_Kyvl8QucIYT-uHI/edit#).

## Pre-instructions

Pre-instruction tasks are provided to accompany each of the lessons. They introduce pupils to a concept to be explored from home in advance of the next lesson. Pre-instruction is different to homework. It is pre-preparation - a teaching approach which is also used in ‘flipped-learning’. 

For the first lesson, the Introduction to Peer Instruction, the pre-instruction worksheet should be completed during the lesson. This allows teachers to explain the purpose of the pre-instruction and how it relates to the teaching approach and the following lessons. For the following weeks, pre-instruction tasks are provided with their corresponding lessons (e.g. the Lesson 2 pre-instruction is provided in the Lesson 2 folder).

The pre-instructions range from text-based, to a video on a concept, to a visual such as a diagram or mind-map. The resources always offer a context for the pre-instruction task, such as:

*“This pre-instruction task aims to get you thinking in advance of the next lesson. You are able to undertake online research about the images in order to answer the questions below. This work will not be marked - it will, however, form the basis of questions you will be asked at the beginning of the lesson.”*

If your school has restrictions on setting weekly/regular work to be completed at home then, for the trial, it is advised that you set pre-instructions to be completed at home to suit your school’s policy and then, for the remaining pre-instructions, ask pupils to complete them alone and in silence at the beginning of the relevant lesson.

## Multiple Choice Questions

The Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) have been provided in a separate folder within each unit. The questions across the unit are grouped together so teachers can utilise the slides in the lesson as well as, importantly, navigate between slides in real-time response to the classes’ answers. The question bank also enables teachers to add in their own alternative questions and distractor answers over time.

MCQs, answers and distractors are provided in table form for the teacher, as well as learner-facing questions and answers in slide form. Both documents need to be available in every lesson: the slides for presentation purposes; and the table in printed form for easy-reference. An MCQ prompt slide has been placed in each lesson’s slides at the appropriate place in the lesson as a reminder to teachers to ask the allocated question provided in the MCQ bank. You may choose to incorporate the relevant MCQ in the main slide deck in place of these prompt slides to avoid swapping between slide decks during the lesson.

## Other resources

Back in the main unit folder, you will also see documents mapping the concepts covered and the learning trajectory over the course of the unit, called the Concept Map and the Learning Graph. 

Together, these will be all the resources you need to participate in the Peer Instruction project.
