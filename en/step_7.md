You should now take some time to read through the Units Overview and Lesson Plans. We've also outlined some key tasks below to help you explore the resources. Allowing yourself time for preparation now will make it easier to incorporate the Peer Instruction teaching approach into your lessons when the project begins.

Make a note of anything that you need to clarify. You can also get in touch with us by email if you have any queries at any time before, during, or after the project via genderresearch@raspberrypi.org.
