## Explore the resources

You should now take some time to read through the Units overview and lesson plans, which you can access through the ['Peer Instruction' resource portal](ncce.io/pi8). We've also outlined some key tasks below to help you explore the resources. Allowing yourself time for preparation now will make it easier to incorporate the 'Peer Instruction' teaching approach into your lessons when the project begins.

Make a note of anything that you need to clarify. You can also get in touch with us by email if you have any queries at any time before, during, or after the project by emailing the Gender Balance in Computing research team at [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](mailto:genderresearch@raspberrypi.org).


## Representations: from clay to silicon

In this task, think about how each of the pre-instructions relates to the multiple choice questions (MCQs) in the lessons for [Unit 1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyqSAn1a81-3HLFTbNwy6rcGMxiZJi-S). It is an opportunity to begin to plan how to use the 'Peer Instruction' teaching approach with your own class.

--- task --- 
Read through the Unit 1 pre-instruction documents in each lesson, and identify the related MCQ in the MCQ slide deck and document. Think about how the pre-instruction tasks will work in your school context. This is a good time to start planning how you will incorporate the MCQs into your lessons, how you will group pupils, and whether you will use manual or digital methods to collect their responses to MCQs.

## Python programming

In this task, work through the live programming demonstrations in [Unit 2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4p10V7mD8agupDCoPWTqqh2OJivUhaW).

--- task --- 
Work through the lesson plans and associated slides for Unit 2, Lessons 1 to 5 and select any ‘live walk-through’ activities. Set up your chosen Python interpreter/IDE and practise the live walk-through activities that you have chosen, making sure that you are familiar with the instructions and confident that the outputs of the programs are what you expect. This preparation will help the lessons to run smoothly.
